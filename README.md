`auth-rs` provides a simple authentication and authorization service for use in other services.
The service is written in Rust and uses the [actix-web](https://crates.io/crates/actix-web) framework.

Users, when authenticated, will be given a JWT token which can be used to access other services.

A [React](https://react.dev/)-based frontend for `auth-rs` is also
available [here](https://github.com/Opserva-io/auth-js).
